### 0. To make *a* Topic


*[ attendance : Myungwoo Yang, Jeongjun Lee, Subeen Jeong ]*

Before coming to the U.S., we chose a main topic **Agriculture IoT** in Korea in advance . And today,  today we chose a subtopic.

We had a meeting over **Smart Irrigation System** and **Wireless Network** as an option. After our meeting with  professor Smith who is a tutor of ag IoT teams, we decided on a topic <u>to develop the existing system of irrigation.</u>

To reduce water use no very large farms in U.S., We will design system can predict weather and precipitation and would give water more flexible depending on them.
